    Payroll management involves one of the key operations of any business which is financial records of employee’s salary, wages, bonuses, net pay, gross pay etc. The proposed system Employee Management System for Payroll is an employee management system that is dedicated to the payroll system for any small to middle-scale organization and improves efficiency of the company’s administration, and salary information up to date. Although various payroll systems are available in the market, most of them are way too costly and do not offer much more functionality for their price. Since almost all the payroll system available in the market is made by foreign companies, they don't comply with regional law, so they have to customize according to region and place and the customization is not easy. the proposed system is very easy to use and offer much range of functionality including management functionality, attendance tracking and using that available information to generate salary and reports.
